      <h1>Rubber Ducker!</h1>
      <p>
        What's all this about rubber ducks? They are just inanimate objects, what
        could they possibly know?
      </p>
      <p>
        That is precisely the point! They <strong>know nothing</strong>, so you
        must <strong>tell them everything</strong>.

    When explaining issues or giving feedback, the best approach is to be
    clear, detailed, and patient. Imagine you're explaining the situation to
    someone who has no prior knowledge about it â€“ this helps you provide all
    the necessary information. Just like in rubber duck debugging, where you
    explain a problem to a rubber duck to better understand it, this approach
    ensures you don't leave out crucial details.

  <h2>A brief guide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Start with Context:</span> Begin by giving a
        brief overview of the situation. Explain <em><b>what</b></em> the
        problem is and <em><b>why</b></em> it matters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Provide Background:</span> Offer any relevant
        background information to help the person understand the
        <em><b>context</b></em> better. This could include past events,
        decisions, or actions that led to the current situation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Facts and Details:</span> Lay out all the
        facts, <em><b>step by step</b></em>. Be systematic and clear in your
        explanations. Assume the person knows <em><b>nothing</b></em> about the
        issue, so don't skip any important steps or details.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Use Simple Language:</span> Avoid jargon,
        abbreviations and technical terms unless they're essential. Use simple
        language to ensure easy understanding.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Visual Aids:</span> If applicable, use
        diagrams, screenshots, or other visual aids to illustrate the issue.
        This can make complex problems much easier to grasp.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Highlight Impact:</span> Explain how the issue
        is affecting the overall situation or project. This helps the person
        understand the importance of resolving it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Possible Solutions:</span> If you have ideas
        for solutions or steps to take, share them clearly. Again, keep it
        simple and concise.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Patience:</span> Just like you'd patiently
        explain a problem to a rubber duck, be patient with the person you're
        communicating with. They probably haven't experienced the issue
        first-hand, so work with them to resolve the issue.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-text">Open to Questions:</span> Be open to a
        conversation about the issue if clarification is needed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>You've quacked it!</h2>
  <p>
    Remember, the goal is to make the complex understandable by breaking it
    down into manageable parts. By <em><b>providing all the necessary
    information and assuming no prior knowledge</b></em>, you're setting the
    stage for better understanding and collaboration. Happy explaining!
